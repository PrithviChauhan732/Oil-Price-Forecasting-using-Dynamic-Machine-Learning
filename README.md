# Oil-Price-Forecasting-using-Dynamic-Machine-Learning
Predicting oil prices of next 2 months using price variation of previous 8 months using ML models, Linear Regression and CNN- LSTM.

* Conducted EDA on prices of Crude Oil WTI, determined dependence on 3 Day and 9 Day Moving Average
* Predicted prices using Linear Regression, and strategised the concept of Dual Moving Average Crossover
* Also forecasted the prices of next 2 months using CNN-LSTM, which gave accuracy of 78 % on test data
* Forecasted the occurrence of crucial worldwide events to reason out the variations in future predictions
